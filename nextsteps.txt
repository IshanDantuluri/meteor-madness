1️⃣ Use existing trajectories from APIs

SBDB / NEO APIs give you:

Orbital elements (a, e, i, etc.)

Close approach data (distance, velocity relative to Earth)

You can use these to see if an asteroid or meteor could intersect Earth.

Fireball / Meteorite APIs give historical entries you can study for validation.

2️⃣ Determine possible impact

For each object, take its position & velocity vector from SBDB/NEO/Horizons at Earth-approach.

Check if it passes within Earth’s radius + atmosphere (~6,378 km + 100 km).

If yes → assume a potential impact.

3️⃣ Predict impact parameters

From the trajectory vectors, compute:

Entry velocity (magnitude of relative velocity at top of atmosphere).

Entry angle (angle between velocity vector and local horizontal).

Entry location (lat/lon where it hits atmosphere).

These three are enough for your crater / airburst / blast model.

4️⃣ Optional: Monte Carlo or uncertainty

Because orbital elements have uncertainties, you can simulate multiple slightly different trajectories to produce a probabilistic impact footprint.

This is optional but can make your solution more robust.

✅ Bottom line:

Yes, you mostly use trajectories already in SBDB / NEO.

You extract entry velocity, angle, and location, then feed those into your impact model to estimate crater size, airburst, and damage zones.

You don’t need to propagate the orbit yourself unless you want to predict future encounters not in the database.
